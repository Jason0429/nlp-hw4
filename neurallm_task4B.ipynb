    "\n",
    "You will evaluate the quality of the generated sentences in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate 20 sentences from your best word-based neural model. (Value of hyperparameters and n value up to you).\n",
    "- Using the same level of n-gram, pair these sentences with provided sentences from the vanilla n-gram model. If you want to evaluate a model with N != 3, 4, or 5, then you'll need to train your vanilla n-gram model and generate your own comparison sentences. Ignore sentences with \\<UNK\\> in them for even comparison, so you'll need to over-generate to get 20.\n",
    "  - Pair them (roughly) based on sentence length, so that each pair has sentences that are a roughly similar number of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, build a survey. For each pair of (neural LM sentence, vanilla n-ngram LM sentence), you'll ask the survey taker three binary selection questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. which sentence is more grammatical?\n",
    "2. which sentence makes more sense, semantically (in meaning)?\n",
    "3. Overall, which sentence do you prefer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you'll evaluate your survey results **programmatically** (export them as a csv). Calculate the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What percentage of neural vs. vanilla n-gram LM sentences were preferred, separated along each of the three dimensions?\n",
    "2. What is [Krippendorff's alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krippendorff%27s_alpha) for your survey data?\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome to use a pre-built python implmenetation of the Krippendorff's alpha calculation, such as [this one](https://pypi.org/project/krippendorff/). Krippendorff's alpha is one way to measure interannotator agreement â€” the extent to which your survey respondants agree with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will submit your survey data (as a csv called `survey_results.csv`) **and** your paired sentences (`paired.txt`, formatted in a way that is easy to understand) alongside this notebook.\n"
